look at find({}) in the controllers, thats where search may happen


Add Scotlyn, Steven, Darby, Michael to listserv. Reach out to other friends to add. 
To Do:
Style:
- map popups, add image?
Initiatives:
- make actions into an array, at least for display
- update - bugs - add image map features to edit page/form
- show page formatting
    - actions, offerings, and needs in styled list (change input as well?)
- make Time key searchable, plus TBD, ongoing options
Explore:
- update user and group models with final structure
- explore page map (how to make all three on one map?)
- add search/filter options
- add geocoder search to maps (for place search - zoom to?)
General:
- Update GIThub
- Create GIThub tickets for all remaining work items
- create search
    - search by name, keywords (index summary, description, actions, name), location, time
- Show individual profile pages as popup over index
- create alert on attempted duplicate joins for inits and groups (addToSet)

Q on mapbox:
I am using Mapbox GLJS to display and interact with three sets of data. I want to display point markers for the different data-sets (groups, users, and initiatives) all on the same map. 
I would also like to be able to toggle each data-set on and off. 
I am having trouble finding in the Mapbox docs how to add multiple data sources to a single map. Can anyone offer tips or guidance? On stack overflow I saw one person suggest adding multiple layers
instead of multiple sources, but when I try to do that I can't figure out how to target the different data sets. 
Can provide GIThub link if that will help.
Thanks!

How will search work?

User sends a READ request through a form which sets and sends the query,
    query (defined in controller) returns findMany() results according to form inputs


Offerings/Needs 

    Change to "Assistance Needed/Assistance Offered"?
    key:value pairs 
    Should these be pre-set checkbox categories? 
        Transportation
        Food
        Education
        Skilled Assistance
            - Manual Labor
            - Organization
            - Legal
            - Financial
            - Mechanics
            - Home maintenance
            - Garden/Farm
        Childcare
        Petcare

    Should Init model have needs/offerings?

    Make it so "support for X initiative" can be listed under needs for groups/users
