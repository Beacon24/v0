## Author
I'm a novice programmer learning specifically so I can create this app, which I see as an essential tool missing from the common digital toolbelt. 
When I'm not working on Beacon I'm farming and landscaping, or else exploring local forests for peace, exercise, and foraged foods and medicines. I'm a permaculturist at heart, working on designs of all kind to help folks navigate increasingly complex modern challenges.
