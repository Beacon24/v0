look at find({}) in the controllers, thats where search may happen
age restrictions?
add full name to user profiles? as opposed to username?
Init error:
supporters not defined yet? 
MAPBOX ERROR
Problem was with clust id redundant names in js file. 

Question: How do I use Mongo CLI with online (atlas?) remote dbs?

Add field for Name to user model


To Do:
SCHEDULE NEXT BOARD MEETING
Icons?

Deployment:
- better secrets for sessions? make env variables?

Security:
- Add join-group, support init, view group, view init aproval.

Style:
- user profile edit page, form is narrow collumn
- map popups, add image?
- move group member lists to separate page? hide to non-members. 
- problem with overlapping cluster circles on maps

Functionality:
- hide account creation when logged in
- ask 'are you sure' with deletion
- make way for inits and groups to be associated, plus groups and groups

Users:
- Active user profile page? - button in users index - show in Navbar?
    (if currentUser?)
- Option to leave groups, stop supporting initiatives
    -STUCK:how to leave group, path hitting correctly, "deleteOne(user)" in controller not recognized as function. 
     problem is with mongoose syntax, i'm trying to treat an array like a collection?
     No, updateOne also not a function, and this is proper sytax, I think?
     Help perhaps needed

Initiatives:
- restrict view of supporters
- show location like groups pages
- show page image is goofy in layout, bleeds through to bottom below text
- make actions into an array, at least for display
- update - bugs - add image map features to edit page/form
- show page formatting
    - actions, offerings, and needs in styled list (change input as well?)
- make Time key searchable, plus TBD, ongoing options
- make supporters into links - must be logged in

Groups: 
- make members into links - must be logged in

Explore:'
- make all locations into links - how? where do links go?
- update user and group models with final structure
- add search/filter options
- add geocoder search to maps (for place search - zoom to?)
- Let index body be search results

General:
- Create tickets for all remaining work items
- create search
    - search by name, keywords (index summary, description, actions, name), location, time
- Show individual profile pages as popup over index
- create alert on attempted duplicate joins for inits and groups (addToSet)
- add small maps to show pages for inits and users
- registration flow, make account and then profile?


CURRENT BUGS/CHALLENGES
- bug on init show page, "cast to objectid failed"
    for some reason the username value "test" is being fed to mongo as an id
    for the user when I try to call for the supporters of the inititaive.


How will search work?

User sends a READ request through a form which sets and sends the query,
    query (defined in controller) returns findMany() results according to form inputs


MEME IDEAS:

Whistling dude with social media vs. beacon 
"The Candidates on the Issues" but with "How the Networks Compare"
    - issues such as:
        - "Your attention"
        - "Your time"
        - "Your money"
            -"Allow us to direct as much of it as possible into the pockets of clients."
            -"None of our business, 
            but could you give us just a little bit 
            each month so that we can keep our service 
            free and useful for everyone, forever?"
Knock off of Facebook's "Free. Forever." logo
    - "Free. For everyone. For real"
    - "What they say/What they mean"
        "What they said: Free Forever"
        "What they meant: We make money off your usage"
        What we say: "Free for everyone. For real."
        What we mean: "It's true! Would you donate a little money to help us keep it so?"


Offerings/Needs 

    Change to "Assistance Needed/Assistance Offered"?
    key:value pairs 
    Should these be pre-set checkbox categories? 
        Transportation
        Food
        Education
        Skilled Assistance
            - Manual Labor
            - Organization
            - Legal
            - Financial
            - Mechanics
            - Home maintenance
            - Garden/Farm
        Childcare
        Petcare

    Should Init model have needs/offerings?

    Make it so "support for X initiative" can be listed under needs for groups/users
