General:
- Create tickets for all remaining work items

- create alert on attempted duplicate joins for inits and groups (addToSet)


CURRENT BUGS/CHALLENGES
- bug on init show page, Cast to string failed for value "{}" at path "description" for model "Group"



How will search work?

User sends a READ request through a form which sets and sends the query,
    query (defined in controller) returns findMany() results according to form inputs


MEME IDEAS:

Whistling dude with social media vs. beacon 
"The Candidates on the Issues" but with "How the Networks Compare"
    - issues such as:
        - "Your attention"
        - "Your time"
        - "Your money"
            -"Allow us to direct as much of it as possible into the pockets of clients."
            -"None of our business, 
            but could you give us just a little bit 
            each month so that we can keep our service 
            free and useful for everyone, forever?"
Knock off of Facebook's "Free. Forever." logo
    - "Free. For everyone. For real"
    - "What they say/What they mean"
        "What they said: Free Forever"
        "What they meant: We make money off your usage"
        What we say: "Free for everyone. For real."
        What we mean: "It's true! Would you donate a little money to help us keep it so?"


Offerings/Needs 

    Change to "Assistance Needed/Assistance Offered"?
    key:value pairs 
    Should these be pre-set checkbox categories? 
        Transportation
        Food
        Education
        Skilled Assistance
            - Manual Labor
            - Organization
            - Legal
            - Financial
            - Mechanics
            - Home maintenance
            - Garden/Farm
        Childcare
        Petcare

    Should Init model have needs/offerings?

    Make it so "support for X initiative" can be listed under needs for groups/users

                <% if(user.images.length) { %> 
               <img class="img-fluid" src="<%= user.images[0].url%>" alt=""> 
                <% }else {%> 
                <img class="img-fluid" src="" alt="">
