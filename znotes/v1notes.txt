To Do for V1 Launch:
- make it so only group creator can make/delete call to action (isUser? isCreator? middleware)
- add update/edit for calls
- Create view profile page for currentUser
- add Intercom
- hide user profiles (temporary)
- auto zoom-to Asheville region
- fork a production vs. dev app?
- Add Intercom

To Do less urgent:
Update logo
    add logo to navbar
Create validation tier
Make default zoom to area Asheville
Add way for groups to associate
Add option for additional user admins in groups
Fix explore groups/explore routes


Bug Fixes:
   - Calls to Action not showing properly on group show page - fixed, was problem with populate syntax
   - Leave groups


Secondary: 
Create tutorial walkthrough (with 3rd party service)
Create Asheville/Chapel Hill Tabs


Iterations:

Profile Page - allow users to view and edit their own profile, with a link in navbar to get there.

Validation tier - add field to User model, boolean "verified: true/false"
    we manually toggle this field after receiving verification credentials
    If profileX validated, show other validated profiles. Hide from unvalidated. 
        this must exist when verified:
        - navbar Users link
        - showing members of groups (only if user is also member - eventually add?) (once this function re-added)
        - access to group leader profile pages

Re-add joinGroup function, fix leaveGroup function
    Both currently commented out, leaveGroup not working. See github issue #19.

Add admin true/false boolean to members of groups
    How do we make this so group leaders can choose members or approve requests?
    Propose specs
