To Do for V1 Launch:
- fix heroku mongo auth
- fix bug: edit for new groups fields (contact, url, urlname) requiring optional fields
    -temporary fixed by removing validation, must correct
- fix call edit/delete/create redirect
- styling: 
    -call to action form overlaps underlying container
    -make better in general
- Create view profile page for currentUser
- add Intercom
- hide user profiles (temporary)
- auto zoom-to Asheville region
- fork a production vs. dev app?
- Add Intercom

To Do less urgent:
add protective middleware to routes
Update logo
    add logo to navbar
Fix link upload on callToAction so that if user puts https:// it does not break
Create validation tier
Make default zoom to area Asheville
Add way for groups to associate
Add option for additional user admins in groups
Fix explore groups/explore routes


Bug Fixes:
   - Calls to Action not showing properly on group show page - fixed, was problem with populate syntax
   - Leave groups


Secondary: 
Create tutorial walkthrough (with 3rd party service)
Create Asheville/Chapel Hill Tabs


Iterations:

Profile Page - allow users to view and edit their own profile, with a link in navbar to get there.

Validation tier - add field to User model, boolean "verified: true/false"
    we manually toggle this field after receiving verification credentials
    If profileX validated, show other validated profiles. Hide from unvalidated. 
        this must exist when verified:
        - navbar Users link
        - showing members of groups (only if user is also member - eventually add?) (once this function re-added)
        - access to group leader profile pages

Re-add joinGroup function, fix leaveGroup function
    Both currently commented out, leaveGroup not working. See github issue #19.

Add admin true/false boolean to members of groups
    How do we make this so group leaders can choose members or approve requests?
