APP 11 (copy of 9)
Build out initiatives functioning.

Completed:
- Init schema, controllers, routes (may have bugs)
-Working on views. Running into trouble with new init display,
registering correctly? check mongoDB. 
Not registering properly to mongo db, multiple data object fields are missing. 
!req.body coming up empty.


APP 10 START:
work on initiatives.BROKE PROBLEM WAS URLENCODE/IMG UPLOAD

APP 9 SEALED AT:
User Profile images working, displays properly.
Started working on initiatives and broke everything, reverted and sealed.

APP8 SEALED AT:
User profile creation and editing mostly functional. 

AS OF "APP7" - added map to display user profiles, with popup markup
current problems:

isMember middleware not working:
    - runs but does not block joinGroup
    problem with commands using mongo? .find somehow?




Initiatives
    Date: single instance or duration? make both options



ONGOING:

- block users from joining groups twice 
    Faster to check user's groups than check group's members. 
    user.groups({$in: req.body.group}) or something similar. look at docs to get closer to answer. 



- separate user profile image and user image collections -or- one image per user for now
- make locations auto-capitalized (?)

- make footer stick (always visible)
- seeds for users? possible with auth?
- map carousel: rotating photos must keep consistent height
- associate initiatives with users AND/OR groups
- add an auto-generated 'region' attr to users/groups/initiatives based on location? 
    >can this be done with mapbox gl?
- user/group locations: how to make real location secret and randomized/approx location visible? Also choice of "region/town only"
    >look at geocoder for clues on implementation

UPCOMING:
- search and filter options
- privacy settings
- make usernames required to be unique, without case sensitivity


COMPLETED:
- image upload for users
- user profile image upload
- users edit profiles
- geocoder updating on edit for users and groups.
- users join groups
- style user profile page
- add map to user profile page
- add map popup for users. 
- added user routes, re-routed reg, login, logout
- added new use profile fields
- added edit form for users
- added auth middleware to hide user-lists, deny edit form
- fixed session redirect


initiatives as own path, 
created by users (one to many), push to user.initiatives
optional group(s) association (many to many).
(if clause, push to group.initiatives)



What does the initial launch need to include?

User profiles, group pages, and initiative pages

Users can become members of group pages

Users can become supporters of initiatives

Users can create initiatives, stand-alone or through a group

Search/explore groups

Search/explore initiatives

Search/expore user profiles

Initiative and group notifications?

PROBLEMS SOLVED:

~~~PROBLEM:
adding image upload to users, (WRONG, but still may be janky) the problem seems to be with
declaration of "user" constant, where I have deconstructed all the variables.
    join control seems to create full object 'user'
~~~SOLUTION:
Did not have "upload image array" in controller scripts
~~~PROBLEM:
groups/users membership only showing id numbers.
user/group association, push for idtags is working, but not with username/title. look at req. results?
~~~SOLUTION: 
I was not "populating" on the show pages for groups and users, so the data objects could not load onto the page. 

~~~PROBLEM:
How do I create a map to display user profiles?
Issue seems to be: usage of const = user, for passport, mapbox, and profile, how can it be shared or parsed out?
to do:
- edit PUT not working? update doesn't work. add in validateUser after?
- UPDATE: PROBLEM IS WITH MAPPING (GEOCODER) fix registration result (cannot read property location of undefined?), seems to still register in database. 
    - disabled mapping makes register auto-login with session-return. 
~~~SOLUTION: 
I was calling req.body.user.location and should have just been calling user.location, since user was already defined.
The map wouldn't show up because I hadn't given it a minimum height/width in CSS stylesheet app.CSS

~~~PROBLEM:
user locations not showing on map
~~~SOLUTION:
Order problem in the users controllers file, I was tyring to register the user (triggering validation, saving user)
before saving the user.geomtery. Moved the user.geometry line up above registration, problem solved. 

~~~PROBLEM:
SEALED AT: Registered users show up on map, but I cannot get popup text to show, I think it's because of old users in database without required attributes. 
In App 8, will delete user list and start fresh. FIXED 
~~~SOLUTION:
Deleting old userbase worked. Old users did not have the required data for opts, or something.

~~~PROBLEM
edit not succesfully updating. was not recognizing 'user' object from form submission.
~~~SOLUTION
I did not have the form items named properly (i.e. location instead of the correct user[location])

~~~PROBLEM
geocoder not updating for user profile edit. also not updating for groups.
~~~SOLUTION
added appropriate code
